# ðŸŸ¢ Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Guided Minority Topic Modeling

*"Discover minority topics in text datasets through guided, constraint-based topic modeling."*

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview

The **Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization** algorithm is a novel topic modeling framework designed to uncover **minority topics** in imbalanced text datasets.  
Traditional topic models tend to overlook low-frequency or underrepresented topics â€” our method integrates **seed word guidance** and **matrix constraints** to enhance minority topic discovery.

Key Highlights:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Guided topic modeling** using user-defined seed words.
- ðŸ”’ **Controlled constraints** over topic-word and document-topic matrices.
- ðŸŸ¢ Effective discovery of **low-frequency, minority topics**.
- ðŸ§ª Includes **evaluation scripts**
